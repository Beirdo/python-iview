Description: GTK-based frontend to ABC iView
 The ABC iView service is a video-on-demand streaming service
 by the Australian Broadcasting Corporation based on Adobe Flash.
 .
 Unfortunately, Adobe Flash is non-free software that also runs
 slowly or not at all on certain platforms. Python-iView offers
 an alternative interface to the iView service for users that
 are inconvenienced or restricted by the Flash interface.
